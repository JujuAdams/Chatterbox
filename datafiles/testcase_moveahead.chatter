This is a test case for the <next> action.
Normally actions happen before the next piece of content is processed by Chatterbox.
You'll see a debug message appear after pressing space now.
<<testAction()>>
However, you'll very occasionally want actions to happen *after* content is processed.
Such as this line. <<moveAhead>>
<<testAction()>>
Would you like this test case to repeat? <<moveAhead>>
