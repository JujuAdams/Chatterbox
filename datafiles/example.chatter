title: Start
---
This is the starting node.

Calling visited("Start") should return True now, since we have visited this node.

<<if visited("Start")>>
    Called visited("Start") and confirmed that we've visited Start!
<<endif>>

Calling visited("Node4") should return False, because we haven't been there yet.

<<if visited("Node4")>>
    Our validation is broken! Oh no!
<<endif>>

<<set $variable1 to true>>

A variable named "variable1" is now set to True, and the debug log should reflect this.

We are auto-advancing to the next node, "Node1".
<<jump Node1>>

In this node, we make a choice, using quick choice syntax, and set a variable based off of that. This line is long, too, so it helps us with testing text wrapping.

-> Choice 1
    <<set $variable2 to 1>>
-> Choice 2
    <<set $variable2 to 2>>

Based off of which choice has been selected, variable "variable2" will be either 1 or 2.

Now we use an if statement to check it.

<<if $variable2 is 1>>
    You chose Choice 1!
<<endif>>
<<if $variable2 is 2>>
    You chose Choice 2!
<<endif>>
<<if $variable2 is 0>>
    We failed to set the variable!
<<endif>>

We have successfully checked a variable.

The next node will use standard choice syntax.
<<jump Node2>>

Standard choice syntax test.

-> Choice 1
    <<jump Node3>>
-> Choice 2
    <<jump Node4>>

title: Node3

<<TestPopUp("This message was shown by calling TestPopUp()")>>
<<jump Node5>>

===
title: Node4

<<jump Node5>>

===
title: Node5

<<if visited("Node3")>>
    You chose Choice 1 earlier!
<<endif>>
<<if visited("Node4")>>
    You chose Choice 2 earlier!
<<endif>>

This is the end of the Yarn testing file.
