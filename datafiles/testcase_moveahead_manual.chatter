This is a test case for the ChatterboxScanToNext() function.
Normally actions happen before the next piece of content is processed by Chatterbox.
You'll see a debug message appear after pressing space now.
<<testAction()>>
However, you'll sometimes want to execute actions after a line of text.
Such as this line. #allowMoveAhead
<<testAction()>>
Would you like this test case to repeat?
-> Yep.
