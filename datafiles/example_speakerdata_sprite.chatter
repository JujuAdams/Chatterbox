This is the example project for displaying sprites from speakerdata.
Apple[Happy]: Hi! I'm Apple. I'm here as an example of how Chatterbox can display sprites!
Apple[Amazed]: Isn't that so cool!?
Elppa[Happy]: A bit of an overreaction, don't you think?
Apple[Ashamed]: Ahem. Anyways, that's how it works, pretty neat, right?
Elppa[Crying]: This is an example of it using a fallback sprite when the requested sprite can't be found.
Allpe: This is an example of it using the fallback character for a character not defined in the actors list.
