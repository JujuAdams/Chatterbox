// Action mode controls how <<actions>> are processed by Chatterbox
// There are three possible values:
// 
// CHATTERBOX_ACTION_MODE = 0
// This is the officially recommended behaviour. The full contents of the action (everything
// between << and >>) are passed as a string to a function for parsing and execution by the
// developer (you). I think this behaviour is stupid but I've included it here because technically
// that is what the YarnScript specification says. You can set the function that receives the
// action string by setting CHATTERBOX_ACTION_FUNCTION. Exactly what syntax you use for
// actions is therefore completely up to you.
// 
// CHATTERBOX_ACTION_MODE = 1
// Chatterbox will treat actions as expressions to be executed in a similar manner to in-line
// expressions. This is covenient if you want to treat actions as little snippets of code
// that Chatterbox can run. Syntax for actions becomes the same as in-line expressions, which
// is broadly similar to "standard" GML syntax. Functions that you wish to execute must be added
// by calling ChatterboxAddFunction().
// 
// An example would be: <<giveItem("amulet", 1)>>
// 
// 
// CHATTERBOX_ACTION_MODE = 2
// Chatterbox will treat actions as expressions with a greatly simplified syntax. This is
// useful for writers and narrative designers who are less familiar with the particulars of
// coding and instead want to use a simple syntax to communicate with the underlying GameMaker
// application. The action is sliced into arguments using spaces as delimiters. The first
// token in the action is the name of the function call, as added by ChatterboxAddFunction().
// Subsequent tokens are passed to the function call with each token being a function parameter.
// All parameters are passed as strings. If a parameter needs to contain a space then you may
// enclose the string in " double quote marks.
// 
// An example, analogous to the example above, would be: <<giveItem amulet 1>>

// Chatterbox offers three helper functions to assist with parsing content strings as dialogue:
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeech()
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeaker()
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeakerData()
// 
// A content string must be formatted in a specific way for Chatterbox's helper functions to
// work correctly:
//   
//   Speaker Name: The words that the speaker is saying, called "speech" in Chatterbox.
// 
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeaker() with the above string as the input will output "Speaker Name".
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeech() will output everything after the colon, though without the
// leading whitespace between the colon and "The".
// 
// Chatterbox also offers "speaker data". This is an additional string that can be attached to
// a speaker for a content string. The formatting looks like this:
// 
//   Speaker Name[additional speaker data]: The words that the speaker is saying, called "speech" in Chatterbox.
// 
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeakerData() will return "additional speaker data" in this case. For
// more complex situations you may want to perform additional parsing on the speaker data yourself.
// 
// The following macros control what substrings are used to split speaker and speech, and what
// substrings separate the speaker data from the speaker.
