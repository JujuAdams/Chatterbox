/// 
/// - Setting a variable in ChatterScript
/// - Calling ChatterboxVariableSet()
/// - Calling ChatterboxVariableReset()
/// 
/// Three arguments are passed to the callback function: the name of the variable, the new value,
/// and the old value (in that order). The callback is executed after the new value is set.
