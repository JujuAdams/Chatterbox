// Action mode controls how <<actions>> are processed by Chatterbox
// There are three possible values:

// CHATTERBOX_ACTION_MODE = 1
// Chatterbox will treat actions as expressions to be executed in a similar manner to in-line
// expressions. This is covenient if you want to treat actions as little snippets of code
// that Chatterbox can run. Syntax for actions becomes the same as in-line expressions, which
// is broadly similar to "standard" GML syntax. Functions that you wish to execute must be added
// by calling ChatterboxAddFunction().
// 
// An example would be: <<giveItem("amulet", 1)>>
// 
// CHATTERBOX_ACTION_MODE = 2
// Chatterbox will treat actions as expressions with a greatly simplified syntax. This is
// useful for writers and narrative designers who are less familiar with the particulars of
// coding and instead want to use a simple syntax to communicate with the underlying GameMaker
// application. The action is sliced into arguments using spaces as delimiters. The first
// token in the action is the name of the function call, as added by ChatterboxAddFunction().
// Subsequent tokens are passed to the function call with each token being a function parameter.
// All parameters are passed as strings. If a parameter needs to contain a space then you may
// enclose the string in " double quote marks.

// An example, analogous to the example above, would be: <<giveItem amulet 1>>

// Chatterbox offers three helper functions to assist with parsing content strings as dialogue:
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeech()
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeaker()
//   ChatterboxGetContentSpeakerData()
// 
// A content string must be formatted in a specific way for Chatterbox's helper functions to
// work correctly:
//   
//   Speaker Name: The words that the speaker is saying, called "speech" in Chatterbox.
// 
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeaker() with the above string as the input will output "Speaker Name".
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeech() will output everything after the colon, though without the
// leading whitespace between the colon and "The".
// 
// Chatterbox also offers "speaker data". This is an additional string that can be attached to
// a speaker for a content string. The formatting looks like this:
// 
//   Speaker Name[additional speaker data]: The words that the speaker is saying, called "speech" in Chatterbox.
// 
// Calling ChatterboxGetContentSpeakerData() will return "additional speaker data" in this case. For
// more complex situations you may want to perform additional parsing on the speaker data yourself.
//

// substrings separate the speaker data from the speaker.

#macro CHATTERBOX_SPEAKER_DELIMITER   ":"  //Character that separates speaker (and speaker data) from speech. This can be any arbitrary string, potentially composed of multiple characters
